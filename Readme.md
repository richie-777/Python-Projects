<h1>THE HANGMAN</h1>
     
This is a simple game which allows the user to guess the letters in a word - **(WORD-GUESSER)**.

For each `correct guess`, the blanks in the word gets revealed.

For each `incorrect guess`, the lives get exhausted from six stages of lives to zero.

It has cool `ASCII art` to visualize each stage of the Hangman.
